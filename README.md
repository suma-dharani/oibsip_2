Task name: Number guessing game
Tech stack: Java development

In this code, we used scanner class to get the input from the user. We used "random" class to generate a number between 1 to 100, the random number generated by itself. We also keep track of the number of trails given to the user. Here we gave 5 max trails to the user, we can modify to our choice later if needed

The "for" loop runs until the number of trails completed. By using if else conditions we have given the message. If the user guesses correct then the game will over. Mean while in the game for every guess we give a hint whether it is high or low. Once the trails were completed then the scanner object closes.
